       "AIMessage(content=\"<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking for the capital of Pakistan. Let me start by recalling what I know. Pakistan's capital is Islamabad. I should confirm that to make sure. Sometimes people might confuse it with Karachi, which is a major city and the largest one, but Karachi used to be the capital before Islamabad was built. When did that happen? I think Islamabad became the capital in 1960. The reason for moving was to have a more centrally located capital, which makes sense for administrative purposes.\\n\\nI need to check if there's any other city that could be mistaken as the capital. Lahore is another big city, but it's in Punjab and not the capital. So the key points here are Islamabad as the current capital, established in 1960, replacing Karachi. Also, maybe mention that it's a planned city, designed specifically for the role. That adds context about why it was chosen. The user might appreciate knowing a bit more than just the name. Let me make sure there are no other capitals in different provinces. For example, Punjab's capital is Lahore, Sindh's is Karachi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's is Peshawar, and Balochistan's is Quetta. But the federal capital is Islamabad. \\n\\nWait, I should also mention that Islamabad is in the Islamabad Capital Territory, which is separate from the provinces. That clarifies its administrative status. Also, maybe include that it's near Rawalpindi, which is another significant city nearby. People might confuse Rawalpindi with the capital too. So the answer should clearly state Islamabad as the capital, the year it became the capital, maybe a bit about its planned nature, and perhaps differentiate it from other major cities. Let me structure that into a concise response without being too verbose. Make sure the main point is clear upfront and then add supporting details. Double-check the facts to avoid errors. Yeah, Islamabad is definitely the correct answer here.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Pakistan is **Islamabad**. It was established as the capital in 1960, replacing Karachi, and is a planned city designed to serve as the federal administrative center. Located in the **Islamabad Capital Territory**, it is distinct from the four provinces and is situated near the city of Rawalpindi. \\n\\n**Key details:**\\n- **Established:** 1960.\\n- **Purpose:** Chosen for its central location and security, away from coastal vulnerabilities.\\n- **Notable Features:** Houses key government institutions, including the Parliament and the Faisal Mosque.\\n- **Other Major Cities:** Karachi (former capital and largest city), Lahore (cultural hub), and Peshawar/Quetta (provincial capitals). \\n\\nLet me know if you'd like further details! 🌏🇵🇰\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 577, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 589, 'completion_time': 1.5477316719999998, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.000278336, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.006277134, 'total_time': 1.5480100079999999}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--019bc1d8-4cbe-76e2-871b-c869c93e3089-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 577, 'total_tokens': 589})"

Here\\'s a simplified explanation:\\n\\n**What is LangChain?**\\nLangChain is like a set of building blocks that allows developers to create more powerful and interactive AI applications. It\\'s designed to work with large language models, which are AI systems that can understand and generate human-like text.\\n\\n**Key features:**\\n\\n1. **Modular architecture**: LangChain breaks down the development process into smaller, manageable pieces. This makes it easier for developers to build, test, and customize their AI applications.\\n2. **Language model integration**: LangChain provides a simple way to connect large language models to other tools and services, allowing developers to tap into their capabilities.\\n3. **Chain-based workflow**: LangChain uses a \"chain\" concept, where multiple language models and tools are linked together to perform complex tasks. This enables developers to create more sophisticated AI workflows.\\n\\n**Benefits:**\\n\\n1. **Faster development**: LangChain\\'s modular design and pre-built components speed up the development process, allowing developers to focus on building innovative applications.\\n2. **Improved flexibility**: LangChain\\'s framework makes it easier to experiment with different language models, tools, and workflows, giving developers more flexibility and creative freedom.\\n3. **Enhanced capabilities**: By integrating multiple language models and tools, LangChain enables developers to build more powerful and interactive AI applications that can perform a wide range of tasks.\\n\\n**In simple terms**: LangChain is a tool that helps developers build more advanced AI applications by providing a flexible framework, pre-built components, and easy integration with large language models.
